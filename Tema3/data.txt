Young man, there's no need to feel down, I said
Young man, pick yourself off the ground, I said
Young man, 'cause you're in a new town
There's no need to be unhappy
Young man, there's a place you can go, I said
Young man, when you're short on your dough you can
Stay there and I'm sure you will find
Many ways to have a good time
It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A. 
It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A. 
They have everything for young men to enjoy
You can hang out with all the boys
It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A. 
It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A. 
You can get yourself clean, you can have a good meal
You can do whatever you feel

Y.M.C.A., it's fun to stay at the
Y.M.C.A. 
Young man, young man, are you listening to me?
Young man, young man, what do you wanna be?
Y.M.C.A., you'll find it at the
Y.M.C.A. 
No man, no man does it all by himself
Young man, young man, put your pride on the shelf
Y.M.C.A. and just go to the
Y.M.C.A. 
Young man, young man, I was once in your shoes
Young man, young man, I was down with the blues
Y.M.C.A., it's fun to stay at the
